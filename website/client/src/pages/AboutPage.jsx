            <p className="font-semibold w-[50%] mt-4 text-center"> Bruin Sportfishing is a recreational fishing club at UCLA dedicated to building a community of students who share an interest in fishing and the outdoors. Our goal is to provide opportunities for members to learn about fishing techniques, engage in hands-on experiences, and foster camaraderie through group activities such as fishing trips and workshops. Whether you're an experienced fisher or completely new to fishing, Bruin Sportfishing welcomes everyone to explore and enjoy the sport together. </p>
